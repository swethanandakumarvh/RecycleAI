## 💭 What is RecycleWise AI?

**RecycleWise AI** is a web-based platform that uses **AI-powered image recognition** to identify **plastic types** and provide real-time **recyclability information**.  
Just **upload an image** of a plastic item, and the app will:

- Detect the type of plastic
- Tell you whether it’s recyclable
- Suggest nearby recycling centers
- Share eco-tips and impact stats

It’s your **personal recycling assistant**, making sustainability smarter and more accessible.

## 💡 Why We Built This

Plastic pollution is a global crisis — but most people don't know how or what to recycle.  
We wanted to:

- Simplify recycling through **AI and automation**
- Promote **eco-awareness** using interactive learning
- Build a tool that encourages **eco-friendly behavior**

Inspired by the idea that **technology + education = change**, RecycleWise AI helps users make smarter, greener choices every day.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

RecycleWise AI integrates a **React frontend**, a **Node.js backend**, and a **TensorFlow.js image model** for real-time classification.  
It uses **Firebase** for image storage and user tracking, and the **Google Maps API** to locate recycling centers near users.
